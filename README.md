  Current Status : A working script.I had to hurry because of submission date of project so some files are made over hour which might not be coded well enough.Just a working script.

  How to use :
    * Host everything in your hosting.
    * Import ptcbaseStructureOnly.sql in a mysql database.
    * Fill your mysql database information in uses_constants/class.DatabaseConstants.php
    * Edit site information from site/admin.php [admin panel username:admin,password:admin]
